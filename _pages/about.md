* I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://web.cs.dartmouth.edu/) at Dartmouth College, where I work at Dartmouth College Security and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, advised by [Prof. V.S. Subrahmanian](http://home.cs.dartmouth.edu/~vs//). [[My Curriculum Vitae]](http://qian-han.github.io/files/Qian_Han_CV.pdf)
* I received my Bachelor’s Degree from the Department of Electronic Engineering in [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html). My undergraduate research advisor is [Prof. Linglong Dai](http://oa.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/dailinglong/). 
* In 2016, my dissertation entitled “Hardware Design and Implementation of a Discrete Multi-channel Optically Controlled Oscillator System” won Tsinghua University’s Distinguished Dissertation Award.

* My research lies at the intersection of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, I create innovative and robust technologies to help people combat cybercrime using machine learning. Examples include developing general-purpose tools for Android malware detection and analysis. Moreover, our research results on Android malware are recognized by Google Android Security Team and our research group was invited twice for a talk at Google HQ, Mountain View. I also use game theory to build strategies to predict whether severe zero-day vulnerabilities will be exploited or disclosed by nations, and how long to exploit the vulnerability if they decide to exploit. Most recently, I lead an effort to develop a general framework for adversarial malware generation using deep learning, a unified and validated set of guidelines for designing Android malware which can evade anti-virus engines. The generated samples can be used to enhance AI-based malware detection systems.
